# indent-formatter README

Experimental, simple formatter with the eventual goal to address
the issue listed in https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/36148
The formatter should run on type and after the user pushes _enter_.
Right now, as a proof of concept, it supports fixing IndentOutdent
situations for C++.
